"""
api/routes_efficiency.py — Bot Efficiency Review  [Step 11]

POST /api/reports/bot-efficiency
  Analyzes every registered agent's transaction history and uses GPT-4o
  (or the configured flagship model) to generate plain-English efficiency
  recommendations with projected savings.

Works with both live and simulated model modes:
  - live:      calls GPT-4o / Claude with real agent data
  - simulated: generates realistic rule-based recommendations without an API call
